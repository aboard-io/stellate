// GLIDE — portamento, MILLISECONDS, and it is a TAKEOVER of a slew this module
// already had rather than a new one. `freq` has always run through `si.smoo` =
// si.smooth(0.999): a FIXED pole, ~21 ms tau, ~96 ms to settle within 1% at
// 48 kHz. So every reused pool voice in this fleet has been sliding into its
// next note all along, at a time nobody could name, turn down or turn up — the
// pitch bend you can hear on a fast synth line. This names it, and the three
// readings are chosen so the bottom of the slider is not a lie:
//   glide == 0   the module's OWN smoother, the 0.999 pole, untouched. A state
//                that never writes the key renders BIT-IDENTICAL to before —
//                that is why this is a select2 over two whole smoothers and
//                not one smoother with a computed pole: a signal-rate 0.999f
//                is NOT the constant-folded 0.999, and the saw phasors drift
//                (measured: max |diff| 1.3e-3 across a 0.9 s render).
//   glide == 1   a SNAP. tau 0.2 ms, settled inside a millisecond — the one
//                thing this fleet could never do, since si.smoo was mandatory.
//   glide  > 2   the named portamento: tau = glide/4.6, landing within 1% at
//                ~glide ms, exactly the contract modeld and synclead keep.
